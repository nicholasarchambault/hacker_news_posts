# Analyzing Hacker News Posts
by Nicholas Archambault

Hacker News is a website created by startup incubator Y-Combinator which allows users to submit posts related to technology and startups.  These posts can be voted and commented on, in a format similar to that of Reddit.  Posts with the most engagement can reach hundreds of thousands of visitors.

This project analyzes information on 20,000 Hacker News posts.  The dataset has been abridged from its full, 300,000-row version, and it represents a sample of all posts which received comments. 

Two types of popular Hacker News posts are `Ask HN`, where users submit a question to the Hacker News community, and `Show HN`, where users post their projects, products, or interesting stories and facts.

## Goals
1. Examine number of posts, views, and comments generated per hour depending on post type.
2. Identify metrics about optimal hour within a 24-hour cycle to post on Hacker News in order to garner maximal community engagement. 

## Output
A recommendation for which hour presents the best opportunity to post and receive community engagement.
